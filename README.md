# Drug Effect

## About

This example app does one feature: lists the drugs from the FDA, and allows you to filter by serious side effects (as reported).

## Installation

1. Add your OpenFDA.gov API key to adverse_effects_controller, Line 4, [Insert Your Key Here]
2. On the command line, in the directory of this repository, run `bundle exec rails s`
3. In a browser, access "localhost:3000"

No database setup required as this pulls directly from the API.

## TODO
- Included a branch 'manufacturers' for an in progress  work on stacked rank list of manufacturers with serious adverse effects reports.
